# LUMA – Smart Blind Stick (IoT Project)

LUMA is an IoT-based smart blind stick designed to assist visually impaired individuals through real-time obstacle detection, environmental sensing, emergency alerts, and both local and web-based monitoring.

## Features
- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor  
- Water puddle detection using rain sensor  
- Emergency alert trigger via push button  
- Silent haptic feedback using vibration motor to avoid noise pollution  
- Buzzer alerts for critical situations  
- GPS-based location tracking (latitude & longitude)  
- Local serial monitoring for real-time debugging and instant feedback  
- AI-Powered Environmental Scan: Identifies ramps, stairs, and obstacles using Gemini 1.5 Flash  
- Cloud-based web dashboard for remote monitoring  
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) accessibility feedback  

## Sensors & Components
- Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Rain Sensor  
- GPS Module (simulated coordinates for testing)  
- Push Button  
- Buzzer  
- Vibration Motor  
- Servo Motor  
- ESP32 Microcontroller  

## Tech Stack
- **Arduino IDE** for firmware development  
- **Embedded C / C++**  
- **ESP32 WiFi**  
- **ThingSpeak Cloud Platform**  
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash API** for AI vision processing  
- **Web Dashboard** with real-time camera integration and TTS  

## System Overview
The ESP32 continuously reads sensor data and processes alerts locally to ensure instant response.  
Critical events trigger vibration or buzzer feedback without relying on cloud connectivity.

Sensor data such as distance, rain level, button status, GPS coordinates, and alert states are:
- Displayed locally via **Serial Monitor** for real-time monitoring  
- Sent periodically to **ThingSpeak**, where a web dashboard visualizes live sensor readings and system status  

## Web Dashboard
A cloud-based dashboard built using ThingSpeak enables:
- Real-time visualization of sensor data  
- Remote monitoring of distance, rain detection, alerts, and GPS location  
- Historical data analysis using charts and graphs  

## Future Scope
- Mobile application integration  
- Real GPS module integration  
- Enhanced IoT features in upcoming coursework  
- Extended field testing and optimization  

## Team
Developed by a team of 4 members as part of a university IoT research project.
